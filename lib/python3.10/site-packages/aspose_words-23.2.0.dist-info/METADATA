## Using Python to Create a DOCX File from Scratch

Aspose.Words for Python allows you to create a new blank document and add content to this document.

```python
import aspose.words as aw

# Create a blank document.
doc = aw.Document()

# Use a document builder to add content to the document.
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
# Write a new paragraph in the document with the text "Hello World!".
builder.writeln("Hello, World!")

# Save the document in DOCX format. Save format is automatically determined from the file extension.
doc.save("output.docx")
```

## Using Python to Convert a Word Document to HTML

Aspose.Words for Python also allows you to convert Microsoft Word formats to PDF, XPS, Markdown, HTML, JPEG, TIFF, and other file formats. The following snippet demonstrates the conversion from DOCX to HTML:

```python
import aspose.words as aw

# Load the document from the disc.
doc = aw.Document("TestDocument.docx")

# Save the document to HTML format.
doc.save("output.html")
```

## Using Python to Import PDF and Save as a DOCX File

In addition, you can import a PDF document into your Python application and export it as a DOCX format file without the need to install Microsoft Word:

```python
import aspose.words as aw

# Load the PDF document from the disc.
doc = aw.Document("TestDocument.pdf")

# Save the document to DOCX format.
doc.save("output.docx")
```
